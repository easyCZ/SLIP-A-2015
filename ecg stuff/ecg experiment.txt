ECG Experiment - This is just a reminder for me (Filip)

PART 1:
Ideally take 5 x 30 sec of ecg data from each team member.
Make sure to record photos/videos of the analogue ecg. I should then be able to count the difference in beats counted by the python code and me. 
The expectation here is that there will be 100% accuracy.

PART 2:
I would also like to measure the impact that noise would have on results.
Talk to Roy about what noise would look like. I would then emulate noise by manipulating the input data and observe the impact on results.

PART 3:
Finally, I'd like to graph out the accuracy of the bpm method with window size as an independent variable. 
While the scope of work clearly calls for a short window, I think it would be useful information to provide.
