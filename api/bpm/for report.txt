Things to put in my report

A) Intro
	1) I worked on the ECG and with the RESpeck PERHAPS OMIT

B) ECG
	1) Scope of work GRAPH - this section should cover how my part fits in with the rest
		a) find bpm
		b) moving window (0-10 seconds)
		c) JSON file dictionary {'timestamp':volts}
		d) return BPM
		e) BPMServices intro
	2) Method
		a) BPM function
			i) theory behind extrapolation to 60 seconds -> task: find times when beats occur GRAPH
			ii) actual function name and code
		b) step structure
			i) step structure overview
				-> why the step structure?
					- background: get_peaks
					- purpose: freedom to let computation give solution where I am unable (because there is too much data for me to parse manually)
					- purpose: possible to build on code with increasing amounts of available data
				-> What do the individual steps do and how/why does the format of data change throughout? GRAPHS to illustrate format and how we go from data to bpm
					- individual steps no prob
					- list vs dictionary. consistency throughout (PROS allows me to have fewer functions, more natural way of formatting, sometimes faster. CONS sometimes slower, frequent sorting)
			ii) table of all available methods GRAPH
				-> justify why some were kept and others weren't
				-> which one was deemed best. Testing provides detailed information.
		c) Testing
			i) introduction to testing
				- purpose - find best option
				- specs - passing data back and forth
			ii) 'Programming environment'
				- graphical format for what i have created to match specs GRAPH
				- emulator
				- Setting -> BPMServices -> CSV/command prompt   GRAPH
				- What exactly did Setting and BPMServices objects contain and why? GRAPH
			iii) 
				
C) RESpeck
