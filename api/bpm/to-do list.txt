5) R - justify why it's ok for this method to have troubles with high heart rates
	a) wouldn't detect peaks anyways because data is not dense enough. Give bound for BPM with current data density.
6) Clean-up
	a) local.py
	b) services.py
10) R - justify not doing regression
12) R - compare fluctuations in bpm to fluctuations in actual heart_beat
13) develop method that matches setting not to BPM but also to fluctuations in bpm - not too difficult. more manual work.???
17) get rid of dummies - LATER
21) google code formatting - LATER
22) add step 15 methods - DESIGN EXPERIMENT FIRST
23) rename step methods to be more intuitive - LATER
28) figure out how to adjust the bad data factor for step2???
29) exploit [1,0,0,0,0]

3.5) clean-up
4) begin testing
5) improve step 1 method to contain beat shape or something

EXPERIMENT 1 - BS detection

EXPERIMENT 2 - abs(bpm - actual)

EXPERIMENT 3
graph how window length affects data
graph warm-up time too

do I still have to figure out edges?
maybe implement super quick algorithm!!! just remove all beats that are outside of window and find new ones towards the end. not relevant for our testing.
