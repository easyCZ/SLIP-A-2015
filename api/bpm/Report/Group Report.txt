Data Processing and Analysis

Data processing and analysis consists largely of the generation of a live beats per minute (BPM) feed. Some research and experimentation on future applications of a 
respiratory sensor has also been completed.

The live BPM feed takes a moving window (between 4 and 15 seconds) as argument and returns a BPM value. ECG data is filtered through multiple methods to identify beats
and then extrapolated to 60 seconds. 

With regard to the potential future applications of the respiratory sensor, a method has been explored and tested to rank patients by their respiratory fitness and an 
experiment has been conducted to determine how good an indicator mean respiratory flow is of a young healthy individual's fitness.

Applications in Health and Sport

Both in health and sport, the use of data analytics is becoming more and more popular. One significant example of this is Calico, a Google-backed biotechnology company 
that has recently gained access to Ancestry.com's genetic database with the intention of using genetic and family tree related data to improve the human lifespan[1].
Another is the usage of GPS tracking devices in Rugby. We believe that the UberVest is could add to the possiblities of data analytics by providing data. We have also
selected some applications that the UberVest could work towards:
	1) Heart attack / stroke detection
	2) Analysis of continuous temperature monitoring (some work on this has already been done[3])
	3) Automatic detection of severe exacterbations in COPD patients (through continuous respiratory monitoring)
	4) Respiratory and general fitness testing (for personal use and to identify at risk individuals)
