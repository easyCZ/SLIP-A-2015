Hi Filip,
             Please find attached data for analysis. This data is for  
use in SLIP only for deriving/testing your algorithms and should not  
be shared or disseminated.
The files have data for 10 patients, each named after the patient  
number from 1 to 10.
Each patient's "quiet breathing at rest" is recorded first. The  
patient then conducts a series of 10 exercises with resting periods  
between exercises. The data recorded is the respiratory rate during  
the resting periods between exercises. You will find a series of "1",  
"2", "3", ..... "10", and these are
separators for the exercises. So all the respiratory rates after "1"  
and before "2" is during the resting period after the first exercise  
and so on.
You will find a pdf file with some notes about the patients and  
summary statistics. I have an ordering of the patients based on the  
clinical assessment of their condition.
Your task is to analyse the data and derive an ordering of the  
patients. I can share the clinical assessment if you like, bu tyou  
might wish to first start blind.
Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any queries.
Best,
DK Arvind
