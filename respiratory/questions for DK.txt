'Health ranking' of 10 patients

	Notes:

		1) What are the exercises? Some breathing rates are lower than rest breathing rates.
			a) Exercise 8
			b) Exercise 6
			c) Exercise 10
			d) 

		4) Getting different values for the same exercises. 
			a) Where they recorded at different times? 
			b) They do not increase or decrease monotonely.

		5) Is 'exercise' 12 breathing at rest?

		6) Does a breathing rate of 0 imply that the patient did not complete the exercise?
			a) There are multiple exercises without data. I am assuming that patients did not carry out this exercise. 

		7) How are there integers as breathing rates?
			a) incorrect processing of data?

		8) Are breathing rates given in breaths per minute?
			a) 5-7 breaths per minute seems unlikely (especially for COPD patients).

		9) What time differences are associated with br measurements?

		10) There are different amounts of datapoints for each patient.

	Patient Specific Notes:
		Patient 1
			1) Many different values for 12. 
			2) 0 br for exercise 1. RESOLVED
			3) 0 for exercise 4. RESOLVED
			4) Good cooldown reactions exercises 7 and 9.
