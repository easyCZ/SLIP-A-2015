I have at rest rates before and after each interval of running.
I believe 3000 rows corresponds to 5 min.

My goal is to find a worthy output of my analysis. 
If I do, then I can use the U16/U18 basketball team to do the test.

LOOP 1
11:35 Treadmill level 5 speed 6,2
11:41 7.2
11:45 stop avg HR 130bpm
LOOP 2
11:50 start 6,2
11:55 start 7,2
End 11:57:30 HR 132 Avg
LOOP 3
Start 12:05:30 Level 5 7.2
RBS 12:07:06 HR 144

Data start row 1613
typical interval for unique value is 37-45 or divisible by 37-45
rates were between 15-17
stops recording at 2243 - should be equivalent to approx. 11:35
starts again - 8996 - should be about 11:45.
Realistic measurements start at 9233.
most likely start of running is 12051 official (when it says NaN) is 12772. I believe 12051 corresponds to 11:50
